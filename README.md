### Log File Location:
Ensure the log file specified in your program exists and is accessible:

std::string filename = "C:/Sensor_Logs/group1-2024-XX-YY-HH-MM-SS.log";
```


cppUpdate this path in your program or modify the program to accept it as a runtime argument.

OpenCV Display:
If cv::imshow doesnâ€™t display images:

Verify you are running on a system with GUI support.
For headless systems, use a virtual display like Xvfb.
